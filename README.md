ðŸ“š AI-Powered Book Recommendation System
A Machine Learning-based system for generating book recommendations using fine-tuned NLP models and embedding-based retrieval.

ðŸš€ Overview
This project is an AI-driven book recommendation system that combines fine-tuned transformer models with embedding-based retrieval to provide highly relevant book suggestions. The system processes book summaries, extracts embeddings, and refines results using a trained T5 NLP model. A Tkinter-based GUI allows users to interact with the model easily.
